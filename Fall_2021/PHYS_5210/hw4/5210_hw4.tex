\begin{problem}{1}
Two particles move about each other in circular orbits under the influence of
gravitational forces (so that the potential energy is $U=-\alpha / r$), with a
period $\tau$.

Their motion is suddenly stopped at a given instant of time, and they are then
released and allowed to fall into each other.

Prove that they collide after a time $\tau /(4\sqrt{2})$.

\begin{problem}{2}
A central force potential is given by
\begin{equation}
    U(r)=\begin{cases}
        0, & r>a\\
        -U_0, & r<a
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $U_0>0$. We would like to study the scattering in this potential.

(a) If a particle approaches the potential with the kinetic energy $E$ and the
impact parameter $s$, find the angle $\varphi$ and $\tilde{\varphi}$ as shown in
the Figure above. The figure represents the potential as a circle of radius $a$,
with the trajectory of a particle shown in blue. Use conservation of energy and
conservation of angular momentum to find $\tilde{\varphi}$.

(b) Determine the scattering angle $\theta$ in terms of $\varphi$ and
$\tilde{\varphi}$.

(c) Express $s$ as a function of $\theta$. This step is tricky as it is easy to
find $\theta$ in terms of $s$, harder the other way around. To do that, take the
ratio $\sin\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{\sin\varphi}$. On the one hand, use the
results of part (a) to figure out what it is equal to. On the other hand,
express $\tilde{\varphi}$ in terms of $\varphi$ and $\theta$, and work to solve
the resulting equation for $\varphi$. Finally, use the previous result relating
$\varphi$ to $s$.

(d) Finally, find the differential cross section $d\sigma /d\Omega$ where
$d\Omega=2\pi\sin(\theta)d\theta$ for a particle scattering in this potential.
